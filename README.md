LaTex Book of Notes on Regression

This document is a collection of my notes for an advanced regression course.
It comes with no assurance of absolute accuracy. These notes are updated
constantly and dated. NOTE: These notes are based on the work of many
statisticians and social scientists, and in no way re
ects my own intellectual
contributions.
I will eventually build a bigger bibliography, but for right now these are
just notes for a class. These notes are not designed to replace a proper text.
I assume you have had a basic regression course and, of course, intro-
duction to statistics. This is not about theory, and I go through the basics
quickly.

More topics will be completed and added to the document over time.
