For comprehensive treatment of clustered data and complex survey designs, see \citep{kish1965survey} and \citep{spybrook2006optimal}. For discussion of fixed effects and random effects models with clustered data, consult \citep{cameron2005microeconometrics}. Additional perspectives on intraclass correlations and design effects can be found in \citep{fox} and \citep{gill2006essential}.
